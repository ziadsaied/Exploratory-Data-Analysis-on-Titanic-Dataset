# 🚢 Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

An in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python.
The project covers data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization to uncover key insights about passenger demographics, ticket classes, and survival patterns.

🎯 Project Purpose
Analyze the Titanic dataset to understand the factors affecting survival.
The analysis includes handling missing values, encoding categorical features, creating age groups, and exploring relationships between variables through visualizations.

⚙️ Setup / Installation
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Titanic-EDA-Analysis.git

💡 Usage / Workflow
1- Open the Jupyter Notebook: jupyter notebook Titanic_EDA.ipynb
2- Explore data cleaning, encoding, and visualization steps.
3- Generated visuals include gender distribution, age-based survival rates, and class analysis.
4- Final cleaned dataset is saved as Titanic_cleaned.csv.

📊 Example Outputs
🧍‍♂️ Gender vs Survival Rate (Bar + Pie charts)
🎫 Class-wise and Age-group distribution
🔥 Correlation heatmap of numerical features
📈 Insights into patterns like fare distribution and passenger age trends

🧰 Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy) – Data wrangling and feature creation
- Matplotlib, Seaborn – Visualization and statistical graphics
- Jupyter Notebook – Interactive analysis and documentation
- Dataset: Titanic Dataset (Kaggle)
